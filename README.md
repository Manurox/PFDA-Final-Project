## Description

Pixel Shooter is a 2D animated graphic game made using python's turtle library. This game involves the user moving around a designated zone with enemies, in red, and allies, in blue. The objective of the game is to score points, the higher your score, the better you are. 

I wanted to make an 80's/90's style arcade game so I used python's turtle library because of the simple look it provides. In Pixel Shooter, the user can decide the difficulty they want. Before the game begins, the player will be prompted with how many enemies and allies they wish to battle with. I added this feature to allow players to begin slowly and work their way up. 

The user is a ship, a white triangle, that shoots missiles and dodges enemies. The user has the most versatility when it comes to movement, the ability to speed up, slow down and change direction. The player can speed up by pressing the 'up' key, slow down by pressing the 'down' key, and change direction with the 'right' and 'left' keys. 

Every game needs an obstacle. Pixel Shooter has enemies, red circles, which the user will shoot to gain points. For every enemy hit with a missile, 100 points is awarded to the user. However, as every game also has a catch, the player must not hit the enemies with their ship/body. That ship is expensive so 100 points will be taken away from the user.

The user is not on his own in Pixel Shooter because the blue squares are allies, they are simply bodies which the player does not have the ability to hit with their body. However, a missile can hit an ally and the user's score will be deducted for such an atrocity. As the game lord, I understand it can be a mistake so only 50 points will be deducted. 

In the src folder are 2 audio files whihc are used as sound effects. Their purpose is to let the user know when an enemy has been hit with a missile versus an ally, specific sound effects will play. An explosion sound effect followed by orange particles flying out when an enemy gets hit with a missile. For an ally, a demeaning monotonous tone plays. The score will change accordingly when a missile hits an enemy or an ally. 

A future feature I want to add is to decorate the level. At the moment, it is a plain black screen as the background but I think it should have a space theme. Better yet, the user can pick from a list of different backgrounds to add to the player experience.
