## Description

Pixel Shooter is a 2D animated graphic game made using python's turtle library. This game involves the user moving around a designated zone with enemies, in red, and allies, in blue. The objectove of the game is score points, the higher your score, the better you are. 

I wanted to make an 80's, 90's style arcade game so I used python's turtle library because of the simple look it provides. In Pixel Shooter, the user is a ship, a white triangle, that shoots missiles and dodges enemies. The user has the most versatility when it comes to movement, the ability to speed up, slow down and change direction. 

Every game needs an obstacle. Pixel Shooter has enemies, red circles, which the user will shoot to gain points. However, as every game also has a catch, the player must not hit the enemies with their ship/body because they lose points. 

The user is not on his own in Pixel Shooter because the blue squares are allies, they are simply bodies which the player cannot hit with his body. However, a missile can hit an ally and the user's score will be deducted for such an outrageous atrocity.
