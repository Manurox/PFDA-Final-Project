# Final Project PFDA 

## Space-Asteroid Game
### **Description**
This is a Space Invaders inspired game in which a player can move a spaceship to shoot objects. 

### **Features**
There will be a point system to monitor the player's progress.
The player can move his ship around the screen
    _(Turtle will be used to achieve look and control)._
There will be two types of obstacles:
    One to shoot and destroy (Enemies),
    One to simply avoid (Allies).

### **Research**
I will need to research and learn how to use:
* Turtle
* Object Oriented Programming

## Outcomes
**Ideal Outcome**
* An interactive screen in which a player can move around, shoot enemies and score points to create competition and fun moments

**Minimal Viable Outcome**
* An screen pops up with a moveable character that reacts when hit by objects

## Milestones
#### _Week One:_
    * A spaceship that can move around with user input
#### _Week Two:_
    * Create projectiles launched by the spaceship and create at least one enemy and one ally
#### _Week Three:_
    * Create multiple enemies and allies with random movement
